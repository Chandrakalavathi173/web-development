                            While Mysore does have some cultural reference of the Vijaynagar empire but to get the most of its origin, you should visit Hampi. The gorgeous city is a world heritage site for housing the ruins of the ancient Vijaynagar kingdom. The Dravidian-style architecture and art collections will enthral you. Right from the Krishna temple complex to the Pattabhirama temple complex, there are many such structures with cultural relevance that would amaze you. Hampi is most certainly one of the most beautiful places in India. Plus, the cuisine of the place further makes it a place you should visit at least once in your lifetime.
